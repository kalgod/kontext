## 🔧 Dependencies and Installation

We recommend using Python 3.10 and PyTorch with CUDA support. To set up the environment:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n imagecritic python=3.10
conda activate imagecritic

# Install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚡ Quick Inference



### Tips
Due to copyright issues, we have embedded the download of the kontext model weights in the inference code below, You can run following inference code directly.
If you have already downloaded the corresponding model, you can comment out the related code and directly replace the inference path.



### Local Gradio Demo
```bash
python app.py
```

### How to use
During testing, if the details that need to be fixed are located in a very low-resolution area, you should expand the bounding box to cover a larger region. Try to include both the target area to be fixed and some of the surrounding context, as illustrated in the example.

Since the method is based on local inpainting, it cannot replace objects when the difference is too large. If you need to replace an entire object, you must manually paint a black mask (using any drawing tool) over the part to be replaced, and then feed it into the model to perform the replacement.

### Single case inference
```bash
python infer.py
```

### Single Model Download 
You can download the base model FLUX.1-Kontext-dev directly from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev).

Alternatively, you can download it via the following command  
(⚠️ Remember to replace `your_hf_token` in the script with your actual Hugging Face access token):
```bash
python ./download_kontext.py
```
